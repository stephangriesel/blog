## Puting in extra hours is worth it...

The last 2 weeks were busy, stressful and tiring but the best part was it was so rewarding. We all put in some long hours and the black rings under our eyes proofed it. We created our first full stack app this week. It was not perfect but I did it and learned alot from it. Since we started I have not had an off weekend, decided to take a break this weekend to be recharged for tomorrow.

Thoughts from the past week:
 - If it doesn't work after the 3rd try, take a break
 - Switch off at least 1hour and 30min before bed
 - Don't be hard on yourself, take a break, get sleep
