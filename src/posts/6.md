## Don't fall behind...

Sorry this one is a little late! Got caught up... with catching up. Yes I was one of those that fell behind. Try to avoid that if you can. You can't think straight if you know you are behind and not on the same page as every one else. 

Oh did I mention my computer crashed in week 4? 

Thoughts from the past week:
 - Rinse and repeat
 - Don't skip the reading material
 - Just start, it will all come back to you
