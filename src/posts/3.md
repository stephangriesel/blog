## It is getting better...

It has been a rough few days. Felt overwhelmed the first week but was able to manage my time better this past week. Only 2 weeks down but it feels like it has been way longer. Overthinking and overcomplicating has been my main problem. Breaking it down and thinking in blocks made it easier, more approachable. 

Few things to highlight this week:
 - KISS
 - Don't move on before you have not fully grasped it
 - I made peace with JQuery, I think I actually like it
 - Pseudocode, peseudocode, pseudocode
 - Stick to your routine

 Until next week...
