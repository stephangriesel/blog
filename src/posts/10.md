## Final week...

Can't believe time went by so quickly. This is where we have to showcase what we have learned in the past 8 weeks, all combined into one project, also known as the MERN stack. We have been repeating the basics quite a lot over the past few weeks so everything comes kind of natural now, of course there will be the odd case of referring to documentation every now and then. We all do it, who doesn't. As long as you know what you are looking for and not go down rabbit hole trying to find the correct information.

Thoughts from the past week:

 - Don't waste time on styling, get the functionality working first
 - It may not be perfect by the end of the week but you can always revisit the project after the bootcamp
 - You don't have to know everything, but as long as you know where to find it
