## Processing...

We have come to our final weeks of the bootcamp. It was alot of information in a short time. You have learned alot, think about what you have learned and how you can use your new skills for the final project, don't overcomplicate it. As long as you can show you understand the skills you have learned then it should be sufficient. Have your final project idea finalized before the end of week 8 so you can start brainstorming the last few days. Refresh and give your brain a rest, you will need this for week 9. Most imporant, relax and take it easy, you got this.

Thoughts from the past week:

 - It may seem like mountain in front of you for your final project, but start somewhere, break it down, just sit down and do it.
 - Cut out all distractions
 - Don't compare to others, you are doing this for yourself
 - ... AND DON'T WATCH VIDEO TUTORIALS
