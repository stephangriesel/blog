## How do you do that again...

Exciting week, we started with React. As per previous weeks knowing a little about the topic and expecting to get it the first time might sound easy but once you deep dive into this and think about it logically the confusion starts all over again. Connecting the dots from front-end, to back-end with React sure was something to pause and think about. 

Thoughts from the past week:
 - Write it down, refresh, pseudocode
 - Briefly look at your backend projects from previous weeks for refresher
 - Save time, reuse your previous code
