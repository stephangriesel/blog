## Project week...

Week 3 was project week. We had to build our own game. I decided to keep mine simple, as in my post last week, don't overcomplicate things. It turned out well, used JQuery again, which made things so much easier but also caused some frustration. I dealt with it, moved on. I did the basic structure in CSS grid, added JS, broke things, fixed again and result was working game. Learned alot.

Few thoughts for the past week:
 - If all else fails, uncomment document.ready
 - Review work & keep doing JS exercises
 - Don't waste time on styling
